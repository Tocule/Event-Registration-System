# Event-Registration-System

In this system I have used PHP,HTML,CSS and SQL to build a website which enables people to participate in a  particular event of his/her choice.I have also created another user which is a coordinator who can create an event and will be provided with all the participant information.This aims to enable social distancing and manage rather a complicated task quite easily by your finger tips.
